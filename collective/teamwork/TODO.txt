collective.teamwork pre-release To-Do list:
--

* Handling move/rename may fail if a workspace id/name is the
  same as one of its parent workspace names, due to crude use
  of string replace.  We need to parse all elements of the
  old, new names, and update with more care on rename of either
  the workspace or one of its parents (hierarchy of workspaces).

* Test for: SiteMembers.login_name()

* Test for: SiteMembers search

* Test for: password reset in SiteMembers.

* Integration test for getting portrait in SiteMembers.

* Evaluate if we want some sort of set/get interface for
  user portrait, or if we want to continue having it be
  read-only (may be best delayed until Plone has PAS
  plugin for portraits?).

* Make README.txt -> README.rst

* Narrative explanation of what/how in README, including
  screenshots of core elements.

* Make IWorkspaceGroup.pas_group() return tuple of group name/id, title
  and adjust callers appropriately.

* Handlers should use collective.teamwork.user.groups, instead
  of directly writing to acl_users.source_groups (this abstracts
  multiple possible plugins, and is more consistent, less repetitive).

* Use UUID of workspace as identifier for group, adjust handlers to
  only update group titles on rename, move, modification (title edit).
