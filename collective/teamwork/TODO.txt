* Remove 'forms' group configuration from WORKSPACE_GROUPS.  Move to a new
  package uu.qiextranet (where the UPIQ-specific integration bits for
  extranet functions can exist).  This should live on github.com/upiq

* Update tests as needed 

* Update utils catalog searching to use object_provides instead of portal_type:
