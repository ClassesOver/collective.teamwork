# more here to come

* Make membership and roster views use the FTI title as the
  workspace title, to support using Team in place of workspace
  jargon.

* Write functional test for the membership and roster template
  output using both the team profile layer and the default.

* Handling move/rename may fail if a workspace id/name is the
  same as one of its parent workspace names, due to crude use
  of string replace.  We need to parse all elements of the
  old, new names, and update with more care on rename of either
  the workspace or one of its parents (hierarchy of workspaces).
