collective.teamwork pre-release To-Do list:
--

* Handling move/rename may fail if a workspace id/name is the
  same as one of its parent workspace names, due to crude use
  of string replace.  We need to parse all elements of the
  old, new names, and update with more care on rename of either
  the workspace or one of its parents (hierarchy of workspaces).

* Update user.groups components to correctly avoid using userid
  when user/login name is called for, and vice-versa.  Include
  tests.

* Additional tests for improved coverage of SiteMembers adapter.

* user.groups components should avoid directly using a single,
  hard-wired traversal to a specific PAS plugin (source_groups).

* Test for: SiteMembers.login_name()

* Test for: SiteMembers search

* Test for: password reset in SiteMembers.

* Integration test for getting portrait in SiteMembers.

* Evaluate if we want some sort of set/get interface for
  user portrait, or if we want to continue having it be
  read-only (may be best delayed until Plone has PAS
  plugin for portraits?).

* Test and fixes, as appropriate, for workspace rename; 
  workspace must keep its membership intact.
