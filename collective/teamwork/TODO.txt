* Clear/remove "Project Member" role from user/interfaces.py, from workflow
  ODS, CSV. This appears to be cruft, as the role is not used in the code
  nor in other packages. It seems informational, and a workspace/workgroup
  aware sharing tab would alleviate any necessity to have anything like this.

* Make collective.teamwork.user.interfaces.WORKSPACE_GROUPS pluggable somehow,
  such that additional role columns can be added by add-on packages using
  collective.teamwork as a framework.  This may be as simple as a registration
  function (and corrolary removal, both keyed by name like 'forms').

* Remove 'forms' group configuration from WORKSPACE_GROUPS.  Move to a new
  package uu.qiextranet (where the UPIQ-specific integration bits for
  extranet functions can exist).  This should live on github.com/upiq

* Assess what it will take to contribute to plone.api.user some functionality
  used internally, and if possible, use that as much as possible.

* Update tests as needed
