* WORKSPACE_GROUPS vs. PROJECT_GROUPS suffers a copy vs. inheritance problem;
  if we make WORKSPACE_GROUPS pluggable (below), PROJECT_GROUPS won't inherit
  the extended configuration; we need inheritance of some sort, possibly some
  kind of class-based global state, using class inheritance for some mapping
  with shared state?

* Make collective.teamwork.user.interfaces.WORKSPACE_GROUPS pluggable somehow,
  such that additional role columns can be added by add-on packages using
  collective.teamwork as a framework.  This may be as simple as a registration
  function (and corrolary removal, both keyed by name like 'forms').

* Remove 'forms' group configuration from WORKSPACE_GROUPS.  Move to a new
  package uu.qiextranet (where the UPIQ-specific integration bits for
  extranet functions can exist).  This should live on github.com/upiq

* Assess what it will take to contribute to plone.api.user some functionality
  used internally, and if possible, use that as much as possible.

* Update tests as needed 

* Update utils catalog searching to use object_provides instead of portal_type:
