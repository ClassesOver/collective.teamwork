# more here to come

* Handling move/rename may fail if a workspace id/name is the
  same as one of its parent workspace names, due to crude use
  of string replace.  We need to parse all elements of the
  old, new names, and update with more care on rename of either
  the workspace or one of its parents (hierarchy of workspaces).

* parent/child convenience API functions in utils package are
  duplicative, need consolidation and more precise naming?

* Tests for all collective.teamwork.utils functions.
