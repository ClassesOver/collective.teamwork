* Remove 'forms' group configuration from WORKSPACE_GROUPS.  Move to a new
  package uu.qiextranet (where the UPIQ-specific integration bits for
  extranet functions can exist).  This should live on github.com/upiq

* Update utils catalog searching to use object_provides instead of portal_type:
  http://developer.plone.org/searching_and_indexing/query.html#querying-by-interface

* Code using WORKSPACE_GROUPS and PROJECT_GROUPS should obtain those mappings
  via utility lookup, instead of directly.  This slight indirection should allow
  for future lookup of better implementation (e.g. per-site config in a control panel).

* Allow for ordering of workspace/project groups (possibly independent of each other).
